# Pseudo Code

1. Start Program
2. Initialize sum=0 (Process)
3. Enter number (I/O) and assign it to num (Process)
4. Find length of num and assign it to n (Process)
5. Find (num)^n and assign it to value (Process)
6. while num>0 (Decision) <br>
     find num % 10 and assign it to rem (Process) <br>
     find sum+(rem)^n and assign it to sum (Process) <br>
     find num/10 and assign it to num (Process) <br>
   Endwhile
7. Is value==sum (Decision) <br>
   if True <br>
      Print "armstrong-number" (I/O) <br>
   else <br>
      Print "not armstrong-number" (I/O)
8. End Program
