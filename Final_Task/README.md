# About the program
<p>The program fetches mails from your gmail account and creates a SQL table whose columns include Name, Mail content and Timestamp.</br>
It allows you to create a new table or continue with an existing table consisting of students name
and compares with the spreadsheet extracted fom your mail, and gives back the names of the students who have not mailed. </p>
